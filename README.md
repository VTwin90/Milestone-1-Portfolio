# **Milestone 1: Portfolio Website**

### **Project - User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute.**

This is a portfolio website to showcase the developers projects as well as giving an online presence for further use in the future. 
To have a platform where recruiters, developers and others can find them to get in touch to network, collaborate and offer opportunities. 
Also for them/the user to see a sample of the skillset and potential of the developer. 

A deployed link to the website can be found **[here](https://vtwin90.github.io/Milestone-1-Portfolio/)**.

## **User Experience** (UX)
***

### **Project Goals**

The idea is to create a static front-end only website consisting of a single used page with at least 3 sections to advertise and showcase an up-and coming developer to recruiters, 
other developers/graphic designers and others, to get hired for opportunities, collaborations and networking. 
The basis for this idea is that it will be something to use in the future whilst developing knowledge, skills and other projects to portray this development and growth.

### **User stories**

#### **First Time Visitor Goals**

* As a **first time user** I want to be able to navigate through the whole site smoothly.
* As a **first time user** I want to understand the purpose of the site upon loading it.
* As a **first time user** I want to be able to easily view information about the developer on any screen size.
* As a **first time user** I want to easily be able to contact the developer for more information.
* As a **first time user** I want to be able to view examples of the developers portfolio projects.
* As a **first time user** I want to view developers skills and experience.
* As a **first time user** I want to be able to access the developers external social accounts.
* As a **first time user** I want to be able to get a downloadable CV of the site owner to easily share with others. 

#### **Site Owner Goals**

* As a **site owner** I want the landing page (index.html) to clearly provide all information needed about the site's purpose and be «eye catching» and interesting in the first seconds.
* As a **site owner** I want any user to receive the correct information for the viewport they are currently on.
* As a **site owner** I want users to be able to contact the site owner easily for hire opportunities, collaborations and networking.
* As a **site owner** I want an organized, intuitive navigation system.
* As a **site owner** I want users to see projects that showcase skills and growth.

#### [Back to top](<#contents>)

### **What is needed now and in the future?**

* The developer wants an aesthetically pleasing and professional website to reinforce their online presence and give a concise and a «pitch»/UPS of their skills and potential for growth and development. 
To enhance their desirability to be hired for opportunities, collaborations and networking. 
* There will be a landing page/home page to grab attention, while an about page to further tell and showcase the developer. This includes current sets of skills, and further skills being developed as well as interests to give it a personal flair. As well as establishing a bit of trustworthiness, Also contact information and form to easily reach the site owner.
* The owner could have their needs and more fulfilled by using a mobile first approach to a fully responsive website which would allow for easy navigation, use and no diminished experiences on all viewport sizes. 
* Clear simplistically designed pages and sections to draw attention to all the features offered (Home,About, Projects, Contact, Download CV, Navbar, Footer) which allows new users to become familiarized with the environment and can encourage them to contact the developer.
* Other features further down the line will allow the website to provide a more complete user experience by incorporating real projects, some other coding languages and update of skills. 
Possibly testimonials/references of the user to enhance more credibility and trust. These will all help with user satisfaction, retention and familiarisation with the developer and the portfolio website.

### **Website Structure**

This website will use a single page structure, due to its simplicity and flow. Also since the content information is not going to be as massive as for instance an e-commerce site, a single page application/website can be used here. 
In the future if more advanced features will be included and more information will be put in, the developer can re-evaluate the need for more pages, or continuing using a single page application/website. 

However, to give the user more options and flexibility there will not only be a scrolling option, but also the user will have the option to click on the navigation bar to easily navigate through the different sections and back again to the main page(index.html). 
Upon loading the page the user will be directed to the home page (index.html) where they will get an introduction to the portfolio/website owner. 
The website will include a central navigation system to provide links to a minimum of 3 sections and providing information to the section title. 
There will be a subtle but noticeable indicator as to the current section the user is browsing. Responsive design will be added to the nav bar, and on small/mobile devices it will condense into a «hamburger» icon that will have a toggle to view the nav menu and its associated links. 
This will save screen space and keep to conventions users are expecting.

### **Design Choices from UXD**
***

The style is based on a minimalistic, readable, contrasting design for easy flow and navigation, as well as maintaining a consistency to allow the user to easily familiarise themselves with the site efficiently and intuitively. 
Based on this being a personal portfolio for the developer, the main inspiration and decisions will come from the developers research and own personal design.

The theme is a dark mode website, with a CSS animated circle with different colors(this animation is inspired by the northern lights, which gives an association of the owner's birthplace: Norway). 

The site will have an official logo in the top left corner of the header, as this is the first spot most users look at when loading a website. 
Clicking the logo will return the user to the homepage (index.html). When hovering over the links on the navbar there will be a subtle visual cue to show the user where they are, and show their current location on the site.  

#### [Back to top](<#contents>)

### **Color Scheme**

The general color scheme is different shades of purple, blue and offwhite color. With some gradient colors consistent of purple, blue, orange and pink. These colors will create a consistent style for the website and thus the brand.

![Color Scheme](assets/images/colorscheme.png)

### **Images**

The images is consistent of: 
1. Logo, which has been drafted from a picture from Bing images. Then configured in Figma, by drawing it by pencil and adding a signature and colors.
2. Portrait, which is a private image from the site owner. Configured by using Clip2Comic and Figma.
3. Projects, private owned images from the site owner.

### **Typography**

To keep a consistent, professional and modern style, and for easy readability, the fonts used are Oswald(for headings), Montserrat (the general text), and Sacramento for the slogan. These are taken from Google Fonts library.
